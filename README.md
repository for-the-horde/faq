# Frequently Asked Questions
...and their answers!

**How do I find out what commands hobo understands?**  
Try `help` in a private message with hobo. This is also a great place to test commands to learn how they work.  
  
**How do points work?**  
The syntax for giving points is:  
`thing++`, or `thing++ for reason`  
If you start with `@` to tag a person, hobo will link the points to the slack username for that person.  
You can also use `++` to add a point to the `thing` for the same `reason` as the most recent points given in the channel.
