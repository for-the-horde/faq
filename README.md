*How do points work?*
The syntax for giving points is:
`thing++`, or `thing++ for reason`
If you start with `@` to tag a person, hobo will link the points to the slack username for that person.
You can also use `++` to add a point to the `thing` for the same `reason` as the most recent points given in the channel.
